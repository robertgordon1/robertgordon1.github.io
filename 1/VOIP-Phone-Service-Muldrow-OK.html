<p>Still, with so much option readily available, and with so much lingo surrounding the topic of office telephones, it can be hard to understand where to begin. While Digital Phone Systems are convenient and practical; they're not mobile. Nevertheless, if your business needs to comply with security policies that need data to be kept on-site, then a hosted option is probably not the best option. The only distinction between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower expense these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the traditional phone networks (the standard phone lines) rather of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
