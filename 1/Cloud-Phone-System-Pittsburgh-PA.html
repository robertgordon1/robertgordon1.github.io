<p>Telx Telecom - Cutting Edge Internet Phone Providers In U.S A PBX system can be configured to route calls to particular extensions or to forward all calls to a particular number, but it lacks the versatility of a VoIP setup. IP PBX can be either hardware, software, or both. These systems connect a main business number to smart phones.

<p>Analog phone lines.
